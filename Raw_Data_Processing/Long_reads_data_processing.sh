# Basecalling/quality filtering and Demuxing for ONT Longreads was done using dorado.
# Nanopore sequencers collect sequence and base modification signal data and store it in a pod5 file. 
# We re-basecalled all long reads with the same version of dorado, but only called one run at a time. Bam files were merged by sample after basecalling.

# all new directories were made prior to running software.

############
# Basecall with dorado version 0.7.2 - dorado-0.7.2-linux-x64
# used high accuracy and called methylation for a different project at the same time.
# be careful with the trim optionâ€¦ If you trim before you demux, you will remove the bases used to sort barcodes. If you have only a single sample use --trim all.
# filtered out reads with q score < 7
